<h3> Scope </h3>
    <ul>
<p>
Cities worldwide are entering an era, where residents and environments are tightly connected through intelligent technologies for the greater prosperity. In this paradigm, connectivity is the platform and foundation. 
Current communication and networking solutions cannot support the scalable, heterogamous, interoperable, energy-efficient, error-free, high-speed, and intelligent connectivity for smart cities. This workshop aims at 
bringing together researchers, developers, and practitioners to propose visions, insights and solutions to smart cities from the communication and networking perspectives. We welcome recent advances in next generation 
communications and networking systems, algorithms, theories, protocols, applications, experiments, and testbeds. With the success delivery of the preivous SmartCityCom workshops, we introduce this fourth time opportunity for the community.
